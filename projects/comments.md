### Project I

Karen, what an excellent job!  Thanks so much for this.  I think these are great questions and you provided wonderful code to answer them.  I 
Have a few questions.  First, after running the code, can you include some written summaries of what you find, or even in advance provide a paragraph
that describes your method and finding that is then implemented?  Also, I wonder if you can add some explanations for how you went about drawing 
the map.  How did you get the boundaries, etc.  Explain this in words in advance of showing.
